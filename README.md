# Here you will find PCB Designs for your Own FlexLight

## Software used

We create all our PCB designs using EasyEDA to enable fast and easy ordering of PCBs from jlcpcb.
Just import the project files and tinker away.
For even easier ordering you can also just download the Gerber, BOM and CPL files that are available in the gerber directory of each PCB folder.

### LED PCB:

The led PCB holds 8 argb ws2813-mini LED's for illumination and is soldered to each one of the main PCBs via the 5 connecting plates in the lower middle.
it measures 140 x 5,4 in mm, we wanted to have this one as thin as possible to not add unneccesary thickness to the flexlight case.
